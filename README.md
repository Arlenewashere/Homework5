Exponentiation and GCD  Provide a recursive method using the Exponentiation By Squaring method named integerPower( base, exponent ) that returns the value of baseexponent and a recursive method named gcd( number1, number2 ) that returns the greatest common divisor of the numbers, number1 and number2. You may use Euclid's Algorithm to find the gcd.  For example: integerPower(3,4) calculates 34 ( or 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 ) = 81. Assume that the exponent parameter is a positive, nonzero integer; the base should be assumed to be any integer. Use a for loop or a while loop ( your choice ) as the control structure of the calculation.  Example result for GCD method: gcd(1543416,144) should return the value of 24.  Incorporate these methods into an application program that prompts the user to enter a base, and exponent (for integerPower) number1 and number2 (for gcd); then outputting the results.  Do not use any static Math class methods for this assignment (this will result in an automatic zero for the assignment)!  Due: 4/1/16 by 11:59PM. For documentation, make sure to include a properly filled out PSP Spreadsheet for the assignment (I recommend using the multiple sheet spreadsheet - remember if you want to learn to work with version control, you can set up a github account and do this instead) , and an optional flowchart for each of the two methods (exported as a PDF file - you might want to use draw.io) of your program's logical flow of how it works.
